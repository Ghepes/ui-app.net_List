"Transforming the Future of Digital Commerce"
About the Project
Marketplace.Wromo.com is an ambitious project aimed at building a fully automated global marketplace for digital products, connecting vendors and customers seamlessly. This platform will revolutionize the way digital goods are listed, managed, and sold by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, Stripe, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.
Currently, the platform is in its demo stage, showcasing the potential of what this marketplace can achieve. However, to transition from a demo to a fully functional, professional platform, we need your support to bring the vision to life.

What Are Digital Products?
Our platform is designed to support the sale and distribution of a wide range of digital products, including but not limited to:
E-books: Fiction, non-fiction, guides, and manuals.
Software and SaaS Licenses: Subscription-based or one-time purchase software tools.
Product No Shipping: Developer Educational content from various industries.
Stock Media: High-quality photos, videos, and audio files.
Graphics and Templates: UI kits, graphic design resources, and website templates.
Gaming Assets: 3D models, textures, and scripts for game developers.
Plugins and Extensions: Tools for platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and more.
NFTs and Digital Art: Blockchain-based digital assets.
By offering these products, Marketplace.Wromo.com aims to be a one-stop shop for digital creators and consumers.
The platform can also be adapted to products through shipping by adding the product address to the Stripe checkout.

Automated Product Listing and Stripe-Verified Vendors
The products listed on Marketplace.Wromo.com are fully synchronized with Stripe.com, leveraging automation to provide a seamless experience for vendors and customers. Here’s how it works:
Vendor Backend Integration:
Vendors use our Vendor Management Platform (Demo: www.ui-app.net) to manage and list their products. This platform allows vendors to add their digital products with minimal effort.
Real-Time Synchronization:
Once a product is added on the Vendor Platform, it is automatically synchronized with Stripe.com in under one second via our backend integration.
Within the next second, the product becomes live and available for purchase on Marketplace.Wromo.com (Demo: marketplace.wromo.com).
This real-time synchronization ensures that all products are up-to-date and ready for global customers.
Stripe-Verified Vendors Only:
Every vendor on the platform is 100% verified through Stripe.com, ensuring trust and security.
Only vendors with a registered and verified Stripe account can list their products, offering peace of mind to both buyers and the platform.
Through Pay settings you can block Vendor money from 7 to 30 days after payment according to the laws. You can divide the money received automatic for the product and send divided into percentages in several parts.

Why This Process Matters
100% Automation:
Vendors don’t need to manually manage listings across multiple platforms—our system handles it for them in real time.
Security and Trust:
Stripe’s robust verification process ensures that all vendors meet the highest standards for identity verification and payment processing.
Ease of Use:
The seamless flow from the vendor platform to the marketplace makes it simple for anyone with a verified Stripe account to sell their digital products globally.
How This Will Benefit Vendors and Customers
Vendors can focus on creating and marketing their products while our platform handles listing, synchronization, and payment processing.
Customers enjoy a curated marketplace with verified, secure purchases from trusted vendors.

Complete project 80%
All marketplace product listings are working. The connections between the backend and the marketplace are complete. Functionality is 80% complete. The project just needs to be finalized for Smart Design. And global listing on high-performance platforms.

Why Do We Need $120,000?
To ensure that Marketplace.Wromo.com becomes a world-class platform, we need to address every aspect of its development, maintenance, and marketing. Here's how the funds will be utilized:

1. Professional Development ($60,000)
Hiring top-tier developers to finalize the platform using scalable and robust technologies.
Integrating advanced features, including: 
Vendor dashboards for product management.
Secure payment processing via Stripe.
Automated product listing and sales tracking.
AI-driven search and recommendation systems.
Testing and optimization to ensure a flawless user experience.

2. Infrastructure and Hosting ($5,000)
Scalable cloud hosting on platforms website for Kubernetes clusters with load balancing for high performance.
Database management using MongoDB Atlas for secure data handling.
Domain and SSL certificates for secure and professional online presence.

3. Marketing and Advertising ($30,000)
Digital advertising campaigns on Google Ads, Facebook, and other platforms to attract vendors and customers globally.
Social media and content marketing to build awareness and community engagement.
Search engine optimization (SEO) to rank high on relevant searches.

Global Accessibility: Designed to serve vendors and customers worldwide with multiple currencies, languages, and payment options.
Customer-Centric Design: A sleek, intuitive interface that ensures a seamless browsing and purchasing experience.
Scalability: Built on modern technologies to handle millions of users and transactions efficiently.
